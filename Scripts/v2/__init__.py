The Python repository "Attribution_SpringNA" contains the scripts, data, figures, and text for investigating the causes of the warming hole over North America during springtime in the last 1-2 decades. Here, we use observations and climate model simulations to assess the role of internal variability versus the forced response due to aerosols and greenhouse gases.
